# 📚 JavaScript Learning Log

Welcome to my **JavaScript Learning Log** repository! This folder will be updated daily with the JavaScript concepts and exercises I learn as I progress through my JavaScript journey.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository serves as a place for me to:  
✅ Document my **daily learning** of JavaScript.  
✅ Practice **key JavaScript concepts** such as variables, loops, functions, and more.  
✅ Improve my understanding through **hands-on coding exercises**.  
✅ Keep track of my progress and build a **personal reference** for future projects.

## 📂 Folder Structure

The exercises and lessons are organized into the following categories:

📁 **Basics/** – Variables, Data Types, Operators, Input/Output  
📁 **Control Flow/** – Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`), Loops (`for`, `while`)  
📁 **Functions/** – Function Declarations, Expressions, Arrow Functions  
📁 **Objects & Arrays/** – Object Methods, Array Manipulations  
📁 **ES6+ Features/** – Arrow Functions, Template Literals, Destructuring, Promises  
📁 **Asynchronous Programming/** – Callbacks, Async/Await, Promises

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** (ES6+)
- **VS Code** (for development)
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control)

## 🎯 Future Plans

🔹 Explore **JavaScript frameworks** like React or Vue.js.  
🔹 Dive deeper into **asynchronous programming** and **APIs**.  
🔹 Work on **real-world mini-projects** to apply what I’ve learned.
