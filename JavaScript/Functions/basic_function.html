    <h1> Basic function </h1>
    <p>
        A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular <br>
        This provides a way of organising and reuse your JavaScript code as you wouldn't need hundreds of the same statement all over the place doing the same thing. This will make your code unreadable.
    </p>
        What differentiate a function from a normal statement is that, functions by itself  will not do anything unless we call the function. <br>
        To call a function, we simply need to get out of the function, and type in the function name folowed by parenthesis();. <br> see example in the script section.

    <h2> Why Functions?</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>With functions you can reuse code </li>
            <li>You can write code that can be used many times.</li>
            <li>You can use the same code with different arguments, to produce different results.</li>
        </ol>

    <script>
        function saySomething(){
            alert("This is a Function");
        }
        saySomething();       // calling the function
