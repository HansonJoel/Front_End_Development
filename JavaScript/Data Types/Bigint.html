    <p>
        The BigInt type is not used too often. It allows us to write integers of virtually any length. For almost any normal numerical operations, the Number type is enough, but from time to time we need a type that can handle much bigger integers.

        We can use mathematical operations on BigInts in the same way as on Numbers, but there is a difference when dividing. As the BigInt is an integer type, the division result will always be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
        
        BigInt literals are numbers with the ...n suffix.

        <em>note</em> You cannot use other types in arithmetic operations on BigInts, that is, you cannot add a BigInt and a Number to each other (this will generate an error).

        let  big  =  1234567890000000000000n;
        let  big2  =  1n;
   
        console.log(big);  //  ->  1234567890000000000000n
        console.log(typeof  big);  //  ->  bigint
   
        console.log(big2);  //  ->  1n
        console.log(7n  /  4n);  //  ->  1n
