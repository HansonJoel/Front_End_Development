    <h1> Number Datatype </h1>
    <p>
        This is the main numeric type in JavaScript that represents both real numbers (e.g. fractions) and integers. Numbers in JavaScript are usually presented in decimal form, which we are used to in everyday life. However, if a literal describing a number is preceded by an appropriate prefix, we can present it in hexadecimal (0xâ€¦), octal (0o...) or binary (0b...) form. We can also write numbers in exponential form, so for example, instead of 9000, we can write 9e3, and instead of 0.00123, we can write 123e-5. You are probably already familiar with the terms we used just now, such as decimal, hexadecimal, or exponential representation.

Numbers allow for all typical arithmetic operations, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

        const year =1991;
        let delayInSeconds = 0.00016;
        let area = (16 * 3.14);
        let halfArea = area / 2;
   
        console.log(year); // -> 1991;
        console.log(typeof year); // -> number;
