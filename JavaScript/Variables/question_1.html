        <h1> VARIABLES</h1>
        <P>
            Using variables, in other words, declaring, initializing, changing, or reading their values is an elementary part of practically every programming language.<br>

            JavaScript is no exception, as you need to use variables to program in it.<br>

            Remember to declare variables before using them. Pay attention to where you declare them – whether they are local or global.<br>

            Try to use the keywords let and const, not the word var.<br>
            Knowing the latter will be useful not for understanding the examples found in various sources, but rather so that you can avoid using it yourself.<br>

            Remember not to use the same names for different variables, even if you declare them in different ranges.<br>

            And, of course, give the variables names that will be related to what you want to store in them – the code should be readable not only to the interpreter, but also to people.
        </P>
