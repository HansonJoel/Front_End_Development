# CSS Outline Tutorial

This repository contains my practice and learning notes from a tutorial on **CSS Outline** properties. The tutorial focused on how to style element outlines using various CSS properties.

## What I Learned

I explored the following CSS properties:

- `outline` – A shorthand property to set the outline's width, style, and color in one line.
- `outline-color` – Sets the color of the outline.
- `outline-style` – Defines the line style (e.g., `solid`, `dashed`, `dotted`, `double`, `groove`, etc.).
- `outline-width` – Specifies the thickness of the outline.

### Example

```css
div {
  outline: 2px dashed red;
}
```

Purpose
This is part of my ongoing journey in learning modern HTML and CSS. All code is created as practice material and may be updated as I progress.
