    <h1>  CSS OUTLINE </h1>
    <p> An outline is a line drawn outside the element borders to make the element outstanding <br><br>
    CSS has the following outline properties:
    <ul>
        <li>outline-styles</li>
        <li>outline-color</li>
        <li>outline-width</li>
        <li>outline-offset</li>
        <li>outline</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Outline differs from borders. It is drawn outside the element's border and may overlap other content. <br>
        Also, the outline is not part of the elemnet dimension as the element width and height is not affected by the width of the outline
