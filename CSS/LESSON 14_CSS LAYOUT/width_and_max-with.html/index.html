    <h1>Width and Max-Width</h1>
    <p>
      As mentioned in the previous chapter; a block-level element always takes
      up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as
      it can). <br />

      max-width sets the maximum width an element can have. It's particularly
      useful for responsive design.
    </p>
    <h2>Width Property</h2>
    <p>
      The width property sets the width of an element's content area. <br />
      Setting the width of a block-level element will prevent it from stretching
      out to the edges of its container. Then, you can set the margins to auto,
      to horizontally center the element within its container. The element will
      take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally
      between the two margins: <br />
      However, problems occur when the browser window is smaller than the width
      of the element. The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.
      This is where max-width comes into play.
    </p>
    <h2>Max-Width Property</h2>
    <p>
      max-width sets the maximum width an element can have. It's particularly
      useful for responsive design. <br />
      Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's
      handling of small windows. This is important when making a site usable on
      small devices:
    </p>
    <div class="box1">This box takes a width of 600px:</div>
    <div class="box2">This box takes a max-width of 600px:</div>
    <div class="box3">
      This box takes a width of 80% and a max-width of 1000px: ie. 80% of its
      parent's width and never exceeds 1000px.
    </div>
    <p>Resize the window to see the difference</p>
  </body>
