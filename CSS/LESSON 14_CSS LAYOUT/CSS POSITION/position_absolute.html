    <h1>Position:absolute</h1>
    <p>
      An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest
      positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like
      fixed). See Example1 <br />
      <h2> So, what does “nearest positioned ancestor” mean?</h2>
      <p>It's the closest parent (or ancestor) that has a position set to relative, absolute, or fixed.

      </p>
      <span
        >However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors,
        it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling. See
        Example2</span
      >
      <br /> <br>
      it is similar to float element however, there is a key difference which is
      absolute element does not respect boundaries whereas float respects
      boundaries i.e absolute position element are removed from the flow.
      absolute position element does not respect the flow and can go on top of
      any element
      <br />
      <br />
      Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position
      the element.
    </p>
    <p>
      See the box at the <span>top right of the screen </span> It is positioned
      absolute and it does not respect boundaries.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h2>Example1: with a positioned parent</h2>
    <div class="parent">
      <div class="child">I'm absolute</div>
    </div>
    <p style="float: right; width: 50%">
      Here, the parent is position:relative and the child is position:
      absolute(relative to the nearest positioned ancestor)
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <p>Example2:</p>
      This box is position:absolute i.e without a positioned parent
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
