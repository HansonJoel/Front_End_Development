    <h1>Position:relative</h1>
    <p>
      When position: relative; is used, the element is positioned relative to
      its original position in the normal document flow, not relative to another
      element or the page margin.
      <br />
      Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a
      relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its
      normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap
      left by the element.
    </p>
    <div class="box">This box is position:relative</div>
