# CSS Layout Tutorial Progress

This project contains my practice and notes from completing a tutorial on **CSS Layouts**. It covers foundational layout techniques essential for building structured web pages.

## ✅ Topics Covered

- **Float and Clear**

  - Floating elements left or right
  - Wrapping text/images
  - Clearing floats with `clear` and clearfix methods

- **Positioning**

  - `static` – default flow positioning
  - `relative` – positioned relative to its original position
  - `absolute` – positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
  - `fixed` – pinned relative to the viewport
  - `sticky` – toggles between relative and fixed based on scroll

- **Z-Index**
  - Managing stacking order of overlapping elements

## 🛠️ What I Practiced

- Creating sidebars with `float`
- Positioning headers and footers using `fixed` and `relative`
- Controlling overlapping elements with `z-index`
- Sticky navigation bars

💡 This marks another milestone in my frontend development journey.
