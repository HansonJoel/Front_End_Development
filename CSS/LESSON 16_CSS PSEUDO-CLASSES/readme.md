# CSS Pseudo-Classes Tutorial

This project contains my completed exercises and notes from a tutorial on **CSS Pseudo-Classes**. It demonstrates how to use pseudo-classes to style elements based on their state, position, or user interaction.

## 📘 What I Learned

CSS pseudo-classes allow you to apply styles dynamically without needing to modify HTML or add extra classes.

### Key Pseudo-Classes Covered

- `:hover` – Styles an element when the user hovers over it.
- `:active` – Applies styles when an element is being clicked.
- `:focus` – Styles elements when they are focused (e.g., input fields).
- `:first-child` – Targets the first child element of its parent.
- `:last-child` – Targets the last child element of its parent.
- `:nth-child(n)` – Selects the nth child of a parent.
- `:not(selector)` – Selects every element except the specified one.
- `:checked` – Targets checked checkboxes or radio buttons.
- `:disabled` / `:enabled` – Targets form elements based on their state.
