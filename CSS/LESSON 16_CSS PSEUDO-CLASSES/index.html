    <h1>CSS Pseudo-Classes</h1>
    <p>
      Pseudo-classes are keywords added to selectors that specify a special state of the selected element(s). They allow you to style elements dynamically based on user interaction, element position, or other factors. <br>
      For Example, it can be used to:
      <ul>
        <li>Style an element when a user moves the mouse over it</li>
        <li>Style visited and unvisited links differently</li>
        <li>Style an element when it gets focus</li>
        <li>Style valid/invalid/required/optional form elements</li>
      </ul>
      
    </p>
