# ðŸŽ¨ CSS Background Tutorial

This folder contains my practice files and notes on **CSS Backgrounds**  
The exercises here cover how to apply background styles to HTML elements effectively.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- `background-color`
- `background-image`
- `background-repeat`
- `background-position`
- `background-size`
- `background-attachment`
- `background shorthand property`

Each of these properties was applied in practical examples to demonstrate how backgrounds can be used to enhance layout and design.
