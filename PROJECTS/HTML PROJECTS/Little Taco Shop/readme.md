# My First Webpage

This project is my first attempt at creating a webpage using only HTML. It was inspired by the tutorial series available on YouTube: [Learn HTML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5PD8ofhiug&list=PLugmuCKU9zuChc6HhXeLfQz9F06OIOL_G).

## Features

- Basic HTML elements
- Hands-on learning experience

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser to view the webpage.
